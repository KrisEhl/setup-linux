# Setup script for linux distribution
See help for listing available commands
```bash
bash setup.sh --help

```
Installing all apps can be achieved via
```bash
bash setup.sh --all
```

Idea is to add/remove apps when they make sense for my setup.

## Next
Add support for
- pipx
- pyenv
- python3.12, python3.13, python3.14?
- kaggle CLI tool
